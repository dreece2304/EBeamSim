# EBeamSim Code Structure Review

## Build Warnings Fixed
- Replaced Unicode characters (μ, α, β) with ASCII equivalents in:
  - `DataManager.cc`: μC/cm² → uC/cm^2
  - `RunAction.cc`: α → alpha, β → beta, μm → um

## Code Architecture Analysis

### Data Flow
```
SteppingAction (collects energy deposits)
    ├─> EventAction (event-level accumulation)
    │       └─> RunAction (PSF analysis for standard mode)
    └─> DataManager (pattern mode dose grid)
```

### Separation of Concerns
1. **RunAction**: Handles PSF (Point Spread Function) calculations
   - Radial energy profile for proximity effect correction
   - BEAMER format output
   - Statistics and summaries

2. **DataManager**: Handles pattern exposure mode
   - 3D dose grid accumulation
   - Dose unit conversion (keV → uC/cm^2)
   - Pattern-specific outputs

### No Significant Duplications Found
- Both RunAction and DataManager have `fRadialEnergyProfile` but serve different purposes
- DataManager's SaveBEAMERFormat() and SaveSummary() are just placeholders (empty implementations)
- Clear separation between PSF mode (RunAction) and pattern mode (DataManager)

### Efficiency Considerations
✓ **Good Practices:**
- DataManager uses singleton pattern (single instance)
- Conditional processing based on mode (pattern vs PSF)
- Only allocates dose grid when in pattern mode
- Efficient voxel indexing for dose accumulation

✓ **Memory Efficiency:**
- Pattern mode only allocates 3D grid when needed
- PSF mode uses 1D radial binning (more memory efficient)
- No duplicate data storage between modes

### Recommendations
1. Consider removing empty placeholder methods in DataManager (SaveBEAMERFormat, SaveSummary) to avoid confusion
2. The current architecture is clean and efficient - no major refactoring needed
3. Unicode character fixes will eliminate Windows code page warnings

## Summary
The code structure is well-designed with clear separation between PSF analysis and pattern exposure modes. No significant duplications or inefficiencies were found. The build warnings have been fixed by replacing Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents.
