EBL Simulation Update Summary
============================
Date: 2025-06-10 05:27:10

Files Updated:
1. SteppingAction.cc - Now captures ALL energy deposits (resist, substrate, backscatter)
2. EventAction.hh/cc - Added 2D depth-radius tracking and region-based energy accounting
3. RunAction.hh/cc - Added 2D data output functionality
4. GUI - Added 2D visualization capability (requires manual integration)

New Features:
- Complete energy scoring throughout all materials
- 2D depth-radius energy deposition matrix
- Energy tracking by region (resist, substrate, above)
- Enhanced debug output for validation
- 2D heatmap visualization in GUI

Output Files:
- ebl_psf_data.csv - Standard PSF radial profile
- ebl_2d_data.csv - 2D depth-radius energy map
- beamer_psf.dat - BEAMER-compatible PSF
- simulation_summary.txt - Enhanced with region statistics

Manual Steps Required:
1. Update RunAction.cc with the 2D save functions
2. Add Plot2DWidget to the GUI visualization tab
3. Rebuild the project
4. Install Python requirements: pip install -r scripts/gui/requirements.txt

Notes:
- Depth range: -50μm to +150nm (covers substrate and above resist)
- 100 depth bins, 250 radial bins (logarithmic)
- All energy deposits are now captured for accurate PSF
