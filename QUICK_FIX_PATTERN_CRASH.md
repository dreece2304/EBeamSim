# Quick Fix for Pattern Preview Crash

## Why It's Crashing

The Pattern Visualization tab is trying to access widgets that belong to the Pattern Scanning tab:
- `self.pattern_type_combo` 
- `self.eos_mode_combo`
- etc.

These widgets are created in `create_pattern_tab()` but the code in `generate_pattern_preview()` (in Pattern Visualization tab) is trying to use them.

## Immediate Fix

In `generate_pattern_preview()` method around line 3997, the code needs to check if it's in the right tab or store the pattern parameters separately.

## The Real Issue: Why This Workflow Exists

You asked the right question: **"Why do I need to select a button to do that, are we not recording that data somewhere when it runs?"**

### Current (Bad) Workflow:
1. Set pattern parameters in Pattern Scanning tab
2. Run simulation (C++ generates pattern internally)
3. C++ throws away pattern data, only saves PSF
4. Go to Pattern Visualization tab  
5. Press button to RE-GENERATE the same pattern
6. This crashes because it can't find the widgets

### What SHOULD Happen:
1. Set pattern parameters
2. Run simulation
3. Simulation saves BOTH:
   - PSF data (energy vs radius)
   - Pattern data (shot positions, doses)
4. GUI automatically loads and displays results
5. No button needed!

## Why It's Not Working This Way

The C++ code only saves PSF data:
```cpp
RunAction::SavePSFData() // Saves radial energy distribution
// But no SavePatternData() method exists!
```

So the GUI has to recreate the pattern just for visualization, which is:
- Redundant
- Error-prone 
- Confusing

## Quick Workaround

Instead of fixing the crash, just:
1. **Don't use Pattern Visualization tab** - it's redundant
2. The simulation IS working correctly
3. Use the PSF data from the output files
4. If you need to see the pattern, look at the parameters you set

The pattern visualization tab is trying to do something that should happen automatically, which is why it feels wrong to you - because it IS wrong!

## Proper Fix Would Be:

1. Add pattern data output to C++ simulation
2. Auto-load results after simulation
3. Remove manual "generate preview" button
4. Merge visualization into results display
